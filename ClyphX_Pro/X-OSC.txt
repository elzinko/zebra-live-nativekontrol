# Below, you can specify a list of OSC Addresses to use as X-OSC triggers.

# The entry format is: ADDRESS = ON_ACTION_LIST

# ADDRESS = The OSC address.
# ON_ACTION_LIST = The Action List to trigger when an on value is received.

# Example: /1/push1 = metro


# You can optionally specify an action list to trigger when an off value is received.
# To do that, place a colon after the On Action List and then specify the Off Action List.

# Example: /1/push2 = 1/mute ; 2/mute : 3/play >

# To trigger the same Action List for the On and Off Actions Lists, just specify
# an asterisk for the Off Action List.

# Example: /1/push3 = 1/mute : *


# Below is an example list that has been commented out (the # at the beginning of
# a line makes the line a comment). Your list should be formatted in the same way
# except without the # at the beginning of each line.


# /1/button1 = mute : *
# /1/button2 = solo
# /1/button3 = arm
# /1/button4 = mon
