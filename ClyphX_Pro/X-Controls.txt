# Below, you can specify a list of MIDI Controls to use as X-Controls.

# The entry format is: NAME = TYPE, CHANNEL, NOTE_OR_CC, OFF_LED, ON_LED, ON_ACTION_LIST

# NAME = A unique one-word name for the control.
# TYPE = The type of MIDI message the control sends (NOTE or CC).
# CHANNEL = The MIDI Channel number in the range of 1-16
# NOTE_OR_CC = The Note or CC number in the range of 0-127.
# OFF_LED = The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use by default and when the control sends
#           an off message. If in doubt, use 0.
# ON_LED = The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use when the control sends an on message.
#          If in doubt, use 127.
# ON_ACTION_LIST = The Action List to trigger when the control sends an on message.

# Example: MY_BTN1 = NOTE, 1, 10, 0, 127, 1/MUTE ; 2/MUTE


# You can optionally specify an Action List to trigger when the control sends an off message.
# To do this, place a colon after the On Action List and then specify the Off Action List.

# Example: MY_BTN2 = CC, 16, 117, 0, 127, 1/MUTE ; 2/MUTE : 3/PLAY >

# To trigger the same Action List for the On Action List and Off Action List, just specify
# an asterisk for the Off Action List.

# Example: MY_BTN3 = NOTE, 5, 0, 0, 127, 1/MUTE : *


# Below is an example list that has been commented out (the # at the beginning of
# a line makes the line a comment). Your list should be formatted in the same way
# except without the # at the beginning of each line.


# BTN_1 = NOTE, 1, 0, 0, 127, MUTE : *

# BTN_2 = NOTE, 1, 1, 25, 15, SOLO

# BTN_3 = CC, 9, 2, 127, 0, ARM

# BTN_4 = CC, 9, 3, 1, 5, MON
