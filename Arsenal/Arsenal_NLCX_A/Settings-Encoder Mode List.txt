# Please DO NOT change any of the spacing in this file.

# Please DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension.  When done making

# After saving this file, you will need to load a new Live Set/reload the
# current Live Set for your changes to take effect.



********************************** [ENCODER MODES] ************************************

# The following settings determine the Encoder Modes that will be accessible for the
# script you're using and the order in which the Encoder Modes will be accessed.  For
# example, the Mode specified for ENCODERS_1_MODE_1 will be the first Mode,
# ENCODERS_1_MODE_2 will be the second Mode and so on.

# For each of the Modes (such as ENCODERS_1_MODE_1), you'll specify the name of the Mode
# to use.  By default, the only Mode that is available is NONE (this is included
# with Arsenal), which is a Mode that does nothing, but can be used with Max for Live.
# After installing an Arsenal Encoder Mode, it will be available to be specified here.
# The name you should specify for the Arsenal Encoder Mode is covered in the manual of
# the script you're using.

# Except for NONE, you CANNOT specify a Mode name more than once for the same Mode.  For
# example, the name specified for ENCODERS_1_MODE_1 should not be the same as the name
# specified for ENCODERS_2_MODE_1.
