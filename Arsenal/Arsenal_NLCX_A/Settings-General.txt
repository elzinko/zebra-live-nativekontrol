********************************** [GENERAL SETTINGS] ********************************

# This setting determines whether or not a Button assigned to control the Session
# Record button will commence Session recording across all armed Tracks or not.  When
# FALSE, Session recording will only occur upon the current Track.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

ALLOW_MULTI_TRACK_SESSION_RECORD = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not Fixed Length Recording is turned on by default.
# When on, recording Clips via this script will result in Clips with fixed lengths.  This
# is especially useful in the case of scripts that don't have the ability to turn Fixed
# Length Recording on/off.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

FIXED_LENGTH_ON_BY_DEFAULT = FALSE


# This setting determines the default fixed length (in bars) to use for creating Clips
# and for recording Clips when Fixed Length Recording is turned on.  This is especially
# useful in the case of scripts that don't have the ability to adjust fixed length.

# The possible settings are any whole number between 1 and 32.

FIXED_LENGTH_DEFAULT_LENGTH = 2


# This setting determines whether or not Modes that send MIDI data to MIDI Tracks
# should automatically arm Tracks upon selection.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

SHOULD_AUTO_ARM = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not the Volume controls available in this script
# will be limited to 0db.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

LIMIT_VOLUME_CONTROL_TO_0_DB = FALSE


# This setting determines whether or not Modes that control groups of Tracks will
# place Return Tracks to the right of regular Tracks (posssibly with a space between)
# when the number of regular Tracks under control is less than the number of controls
# available for controlling Tracks.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

RIGHT_JUSTIFY_RETURNS = TRUE



********************************** [CLIP LOOP EDITING] *******************************

# This setting determines whether or not a Clip's Start Marker should be moved to the
# beginning of the Clip's Loop when the Clip's Loop is edited.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

MOVE_START_WITH_LOOP = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not to zoom in on the Clip's Loop when the Clip's
# Loop is edited.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

ZOOM_LOOP_ON_EDIT = TRUE



********************************** [MODE LINKING SETTINGS] ****************************

# This setting specifies the Arsenal-powered Control Surface script that this script's
# Encoder and/or Matrix Modes will be linked to.  When linked, switching between Modes in
# this script will also switch between Modes in the script it's linked to and vice versa.

# IMPORTANT NOTE! The script names that you should use here are exactly as shown in
# Live's Control Surface menu.  However, if the name contains spaces (such as Arsenal LPP A),
# the spaces should be replaced with underscores (such as Arsenal_LPP_A).

# The possible settings are the name of an Arsenal-powered Control Surface script or NONE.

LINK_MODES_TO = NONE


# This setting determines the way in which this script will be linked to the script
# specified above.

# The possible settings are:
#    MATRIX (to link Matrix Mode switching)
#    ENCODER (to link Encoder Mode switching)
#    BOTH (to link Matrix and Encoder Mode switching)

MODE_LINK_TYPE = MATRIX
