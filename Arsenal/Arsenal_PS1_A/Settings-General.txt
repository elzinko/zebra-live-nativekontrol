# Please DO NOT change any of the spacing in this file.

# Please DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension.  When done making

# After saving this file, you will need to load a new Live Set/reload the
# current Live Set for your changes to take effect.



********************************** [GENERAL SETTINGS] ********************************

# This setting determines whether or not a Button assigned to control the Session
# Record button will commence Session recording across all armed Tracks or not.  When
# FALSE, Session recording will only occur upon the current Track.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

ALLOW_MULTI_TRACK_SESSION_RECORD = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not Fixed Length Recording is turned on by default.
# When on, recording Clips via this script will result in Clips with fixed lengths.  This
# is especially useful in the case of scripts that don't have the ability to turn Fixed
# Length Recording on/off.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

FIXED_LENGTH_ON_BY_DEFAULT = FALSE


# This setting determines the default fixed length (in bars) to use for creating Clips
# and for recording Clips when Fixed Length Recording is turned on.  This is especially
# useful in the case of scripts that don't have the ability to adjust fixed length.

# The possible settings are any whole number between 1 and 32.

FIXED_LENGTH_DEFAULT_LENGTH = 2


# This setting determines whether or not Modes that send MIDI data to MIDI Tracks
# should automatically arm Tracks upon selection.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

SHOULD_AUTO_ARM = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not the Volume controls available in this script
# will be limited to 0db.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

LIMIT_VOLUME_CONTROL_TO_0_DB = FALSE


# This setting determines whether or not Modes that control groups of Tracks will
# place Return Tracks to the right of regular Tracks (posssibly with a space between)
# when the number of regular Tracks under control is less than the number of controls
# available for controlling Tracks.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

RIGHT_JUSTIFY_RETURNS = TRUE



********************************** [CLIP LOOP EDITING] *******************************

# This setting determines whether or not a Clip's Start Marker should be moved to the
# beginning of the Clip's Loop when the Clip's Loop is edited.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

MOVE_START_WITH_LOOP = TRUE


# This setting determines whether or not to zoom in on the Clip's Loop when the Clip's
# Loop is edited.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

ZOOM_LOOP_ON_EDIT = TRUE



********************************** [MATRIX SETTINGS] *********************************

# This setting determines the smoothing speed that Intelligent Button Sliders and X/Y
# pads should use.

# The possible settings are any whole number between 1 and 20 (specify 1 for no smoothing).

SMOOTHING_SPEED = 2


# This setting determines whether the velocity of the Buttons used in Intelligent
# Button Sliders or X/Y pads should set the smoothing speed to use.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

VELOCITY_SENSITIVE_SMOOTHING = TRUE



********************************** [MODE LINKING SETTINGS] ****************************

# This setting determines whether switching between Encoder Modes will also switch between
# Matrix Modes and vice versa.  In other words, Encoder Modes and Matrix Modes will be
# linked together.

# The possible settings are TRUE or FALSE.

INTERNAL_MODES_LINK = FALSE


# This setting specifies the Arsenal-powered Control Surface script that this script's
# Encoder and/or Matrix Modes will be linked to.  When linked, switching between Modes in
# this script will also switch between Modes in the script it's linked to and vice versa.

# IMPORTANT NOTE! The script names that you should use here are exactly as shown in
# Live's Control Surface menu.  However, if the name contains spaces (such as Arsenal LPP A),
# the spaces should be replaced with underscores (such as Arsenal_LPP_A).

# The possible settings are the name of an Arsenal-powered Control Surface script or NONE.

LINK_MODES_TO = NONE


# This setting determines the way in which this script will be linked to the script
# specified above.

# The possible settings are:
#    MATRIX (to link Matrix Mode switching)
#    ENCODER (to link Encoder Mode switching)
#    BOTH (to link Matrix and Encoder Mode switching)

MODE_LINK_TYPE = MATRIX



****************************** [SCRIPT SPECIFIC SETTINGS] *****************************

# This setting determines the Velocity Curve the Pads should use.

# The possible settings are LINEAR, LOG 1, LOG 2, LOG 3, LOG 4 or LOG 5.

VELOCITY_CURVE = LOG 1


# This setting determines the Pad Threshold the Pads should use.

# The possible settings are any whole number in the range of -20 to 20.

PAD_THRESHOLD = 0
