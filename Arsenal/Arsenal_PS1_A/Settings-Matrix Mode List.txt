********************************** [MATRIX MODES] ************************************

# The following settings determine the Matrix Modes that will be accessible for the
# script you're using and the order in which the Matrix Modes will be accessed.  For
# example, the Mode specified for MODE_1 will be the first Mode, MODE_2 will be the
# second Mode and so on.

# For each of the Modes (such as MODE_1), you'll specify the name of the Mode to use.
# By default, the only Modes that are available are SESSION (sets up the Matrix for
# clip launching) and NONE (a Mode that does nothing, but can be used with Max for
# Live), both of which are included with Arsenal.  After installing an Arsenal Matrix
# Mode, it will be available to be specified here.  The name you should specify for the
# Arsenal Matrix Mode is covered in the manual of the script you're using.
