********************************** [LINKING SETTINGS] ********************************

# The following settings allow you to link up to 6 scripts together so that they control
# Tracks and/or Scenes relative to each other.  Each script listed here will be linked to
# the script above it.  So SCRIPT_2 links to SCRIPT_1, SCRIPT_3 links to SCRIPT_2 and so
# on.  For each pair of scripts, you can specify the type of linking to use:

# HORIZONTAL = The 2nd script will control the group of Tracks to the right of the group
# of Tracks the 1st script is controlling.

# VERTICAL = The 2nd script will control the group of Scenes beneath the group of Scenes
# the 1st script is controlling. This type of linking is only possible if both scripts
# include a matrix.

# MATCHED = The 1st and 2nd scripts will control the same group of Tracks and (if both
# scripts include a matrix) Scenes.

# IMPORTANT NOTE! The script names that you should use below are exactly as shown in
# Live's Control Surface menu.  However, if the name contains spaces (such as Arsenal LPP A),
# the spaces should be replaced with underscores (such as Arsenal_LPP_A).
