# Please DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension.  When done making

********************************** [DRUM RACK SETTINGS] ******************************

# The following settings determine the LED colors to use for Pads controlling the
# Drum Rack.

# For all of these settings, the names of the usable LED colors can be found in the
# LED COLORS section below.



********************************** [BASIC SETTINGS] **********************************

# The following settings define the LED colors to use for basic Drum Rack pad states.
# By default, these settings will be ignored and a default LED color will be used.
# To override the default, remove the '#' before the setting (such as PAD_EMPTY) and
# specify the LED color to use.

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that
# are empty.
#PAD_EMPTY = BLACK

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that
# aren't empty.
#PAD_NOT_EMPTY = YELLOW

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that
# are selected.
#PAD_SELECTED = GREEN

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that
# are muted.
#PAD_MUTED = AMBER

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that
# are soloed.
#PAD_SOLOED = BLUE



********************************** [NAME TO LED ASSOCIATIONS] ************************

# Below you can define associations between Drum Rack pad names (or portions of pad
# names) and LED colors.

# For example, you could associate any Drum Rack pad that contains the word 'Kick' in
# its name with RED.  That would look like this:
# Kick = RED

# Multiple names can be associated with the same LED color.  This allows for dealing
# with cases where different names (such as 'Snare' and 'Snr') refer to the same type
# of sound.  That would look like this:
# Snare = BLUE
# Snr = BLUE

# Note that the pad names you specify here are NOT case-sensitive.  Also, the
# associations you create here will override the PAD_NOT_EMPTY setting above.
# Create your associations below.  Put each association on its own line.  Each line
# should start with a Drum Rack pad name (or portion of a pad name) and use the format
# shown in the examples above.
