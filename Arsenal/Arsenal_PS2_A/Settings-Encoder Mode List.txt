********************************** [ENCODER MODES] ************************************

# The following settings determine the Encoder Modes that will be accessible for the
# script you're using and the order in which the Encoder Modes will be accessed.  For
# example, the Mode specified for MODE_1 will be the first Mode, MODE_2 will be the
# second Mode and so on.

# For each of the Modes (such as MODE_1), you'll specify the name of the Mode to use.
# By default, the only Mode that is available is NONE (this is included with Arsenal),
# which is a Mode that does nothing, but can be used with Max for Live.  After installing
# an Arsenal Encoder Mode, it will be available to be specified here.  The name you
# should specify for the Arsenal Encoder Mode is covered in the manual of the script
# you're using.
